# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start the Server

the server is set up to listen on port 1111
so you will have http://localhost:1111

```bash
# start your mongodb server first (you might need to install it first)
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0

# using npm to start the node server with mongodb
npm run dev


```
